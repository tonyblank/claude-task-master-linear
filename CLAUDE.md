# Claude Memory for TaskMaster Linear Project

## Key Rules
- **Project root is /app** - We are running the MCP server in a Docker container
- This is a forked TaskMaster repo that we're building on (eating our own dogfood)
- The MCP server runs in a container, so all TaskMaster operations use `/app` as project root

## GitHub Workflow Preferences
- **Always use GitHub for code collaboration** - PRs, issues, discussions
- **Target my fork for PRs** - Never merge to upstream unless explicitly requested
- **Commit messages and PR descriptions**: Write as if you are me (Tony Blank)
  - Use first person ("I", "my", "we")
  - Match my writing style and tone
  - Reference specific implementation details I care about
