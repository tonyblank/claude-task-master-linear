# Claude Memory for TaskMaster Linear Project

## Key Rules
- **Project root is /app** - We are running the MCP server in a Docker container
- This is a forked TaskMaster repo that we're building on (eating our own dogfood)
- The MCP server runs in a container, so all TaskMaster operations use `/app` as project root

## Project Context
- Working on TaskMaster Linear integration
- Currently on branch: task_1
- Main branch: main
- Using containerized development environment
