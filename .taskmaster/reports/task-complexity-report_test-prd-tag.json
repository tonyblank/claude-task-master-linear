			"taskId": 1,

			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks such as initializing npm, creating directory structure, installing dependencies, configuring package.json, adding configuration files, and setting up the main entry point.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves several standard setup steps that are well-defined and sequential, with low algorithmic complexity but moderate procedural detail. Each step is independent and can be assigned as a subtask, making the overall complexity moderate."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Functionality and CLI Interface",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing main logic, designing CLI commands, creating the CLI entry point, integrating business logic, adding error handling, formatting output, and ensuring CLI executability.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires both application logic and user interface (CLI) development, including error handling and integration. The need to coordinate between core logic and CLI, plus ensuring usability, increases complexity and warrants detailed subtasking."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Testing Suite and Validation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for configuring Jest, writing unit tests, writing integration tests, testing CLI commands, setting up coverage reporting, and preparing test fixtures/mocks.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing involves multiple types of tests and configuration steps. While each is straightforward, the breadth of coverage and need for automation and validation increases the overall complexity."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for npm initialization, package.json setup, directory structure creation, dependency installation, CLI entry point creation, package.json bin configuration, and CLI executability.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines project setup with initial CLI implementation. While each step is standard, the integration of CLI elements adds a layer of complexity beyond a basic setup."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing each feature (A, B, C), setting up the testing framework, writing tests for each feature, integrating CLI with core logic, and adding coverage reporting.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires simultaneous development of multiple features, integration with CLI, and comprehensive testing. The coordination and depth required for both implementation and validation make it the most complex among the listed tasks."
