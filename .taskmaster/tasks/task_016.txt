# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Category Label System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Create and manage category labels for task types (Feature, Bug, Chore, etc.)
# Details:
Implement category detection and labeling system with default categories: Feature, Bug, Chore, Documentation, Testing, Research, Optimization. Allow configuration of custom categories and automatic category assignment based on task content or manual specification.

# Test Strategy:
Test category assignment for different types of tasks. Verify category labels are created in Linear and properly applied. Test custom category configuration and label creation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define default category set and colors [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a comprehensive set of default issue categories with associated color schemes for visual identification in Linear
### Details:
Create a predefined list of common issue categories (e.g., Bug, Feature, Enhancement, Documentation, Security, Performance) with corresponding hex color codes. Define category hierarchy and naming conventions. Document category descriptions and usage guidelines.

## 2. Implement category detection/assignment logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop intelligent algorithms to automatically detect and assign appropriate categories to issues based on content analysis
### Details:
Build keyword matching, pattern recognition, and machine learning models to analyze issue titles, descriptions, and metadata. Implement confidence scoring system for category assignments. Create fallback mechanisms for ambiguous cases and manual override capabilities.

## 3. Create category labels in Linear [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Set up the defined category labels within Linear's label management system with proper configuration
### Details:
Use Linear API to programmatically create category labels with assigned colors. Configure label properties, permissions, and visibility settings. Establish label naming conventions and organize labels in Linear's interface for easy management.

## 4. Add custom category configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Implement user interface and backend functionality to allow customization of category sets and detection rules
### Details:
Build configuration UI for adding, editing, and removing custom categories. Implement validation for custom category rules and color selections. Create import/export functionality for category configurations and provide API endpoints for programmatic category management.
