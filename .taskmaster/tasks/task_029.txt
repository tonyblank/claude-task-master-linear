# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Security and Data Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Add security measures for API key handling and data validation for all inputs
# Details:
Implement secure API key storage and handling practices. Add input validation for all user inputs and API responses. Ensure sensitive information is never logged or exposed. Implement proper sanitization for task content before sending to Linear API.

# Test Strategy:
Test that API keys are never exposed in logs or error messages. Verify input validation prevents injection attacks and handles malformed data. Test with various edge cases and malicious inputs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit API key handling for security [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct comprehensive security audit of API key storage, transmission, and usage patterns to identify vulnerabilities
### Details:
Review API key storage mechanisms, encryption at rest, secure transmission protocols, key rotation policies, access controls, and ensure keys are not exposed in client-side code or version control

## 2. Implement input sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and deploy robust input sanitization mechanisms to clean and filter all incoming data
### Details:
Create sanitization functions for different data types, implement HTML encoding, SQL injection prevention, script tag removal, and establish sanitization middleware for all API endpoints

## 3. Add validation for all user inputs [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive input validation rules and checks for all user-provided data
### Details:
Define validation schemas, implement type checking, length limits, format validation, whitelist allowed characters, add server-side validation for all forms and API inputs, and create validation error handling

## 4. Prevent sensitive data in logs [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Review and modify logging practices to ensure sensitive information is not recorded in application logs
### Details:
Audit existing log statements, implement data masking for sensitive fields, create secure logging guidelines, configure log levels appropriately, and ensure API keys, passwords, and PII are never logged

## 5. Security test common vulnerabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2, 29.3, 29.4
### Description: Execute comprehensive security testing to identify and validate protection against common web application vulnerabilities
### Details:
Perform OWASP Top 10 vulnerability testing, conduct penetration testing for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass, privilege escalation, and create automated security test suite
