# Task ID: 2
# Title: Extend Taskmaster Config Schema for Linear Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and implement the configuration structure for Linear integration settings
# Details:
Extend Taskmaster's config.json to include a 'linear' section with fields: teamId, projectId, autoSync, stateMapping, useTaskmasterLabel, useLanguageLabels, useCategoryLabels. Implement config reading/writing utilities that can safely update the JSON structure without corrupting existing settings.

# Test Strategy:
Test config file creation, reading, and updating. Verify that malformed JSON is handled gracefully and that config changes persist correctly across CLI sessions.
