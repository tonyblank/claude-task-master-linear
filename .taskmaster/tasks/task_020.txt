# Title: Implement Manual Sync Commands (sync-pending)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create commands for manually syncing unsynced tasks and checking sync status
# Details:
Implement sync-pending command to find and sync tasks without Linear IDs. Create sync-status command to audit sync state and identify discrepancies. Handle retry logic for failed sync operations and provide clear feedback on sync results.

# Test Strategy:
Test sync-pending with tasks created while offline. Verify sync-status correctly identifies unsynced tasks and status discrepancies. Test retry logic for previously failed sync operations.
