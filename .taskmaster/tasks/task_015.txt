# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Language Label Detection and Sync
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Add support for programming language labels on Linear issues
# Details:
Implement language detection from task content or allow manual configuration of project language. Create language-specific labels in Linear with appropriate colors (following GitHub's language color scheme). Apply language labels to issues based on detected or configured language.

# Test Strategy:
Test language detection from task descriptions containing code snippets or file extensions. Verify language labels are created with correct colors and applied to appropriate issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement language detection logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop algorithms to automatically detect programming languages in code repositories or files using file extensions, syntax patterns, and content analysis heuristics
### Details:
Create detection mechanisms that analyze file extensions (.js, .py, .java, etc.), examine code syntax patterns, and implement fallback heuristics for ambiguous cases. Include support for multiple languages within a single repository.

## 2. Create language labels with GitHub colors [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a labeling system that uses GitHub's official color scheme for different programming languages
### Details:
Map programming languages to their corresponding GitHub color codes (e.g., JavaScript: #f1e05a, Python: #3572A5, Java: #b07219). Create label templates and styling components that maintain consistency with GitHub's visual standards.

## 3. Apply labels based on detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Integrate the language detection logic with the labeling system to automatically assign appropriate colored labels to detected languages
### Details:
Connect the detection algorithms with the label creation system to automatically tag repositories or files with their detected languages. Implement batch processing for multiple files and handle edge cases where detection confidence is low.

## 4. Add manual language override option [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Implement user interface and functionality allowing manual correction or override of automatically detected language labels
### Details:
Create user controls for manually selecting or changing language labels when automatic detection is incorrect. Include options to add custom languages, remove incorrect labels, and save user preferences for future detection improvements.
