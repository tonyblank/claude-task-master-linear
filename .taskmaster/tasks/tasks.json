Document all changes thoroughly and provide clear error messages when quality checks fail.",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Coverage Thresholds Testing**:\n   - Verify CI pipeline fails when test coverage falls below 80%\n   - Create a test case with deliberately low coverage to confirm threshold enforcement\n   - Check that coverage reports are correctly generated and displayed in CI\n\n2. **Security Scanning Testing**:\n   - Verify npm audit runs successfully in CI pipeline\n   - Test with a known vulnerable dependency (in a controlled environment) to confirm build failures\n   - Confirm audit reports are properly captured and displayed in CI logs\n\n3. **Dependabot Configuration Testing**:\n   - Verify Dependabot configuration by checking if it creates PRs for outdated dependencies\n   - Test PR creation, labeling, and assignment works as expected\n   - Confirm weekly schedule is respected\n\n4. **Pre-commit Hooks Testing**:\n   - Test each pre-commit hook individually to ensure it catches issues\n   - Verify hooks can be bypassed with appropriate Git commands when necessary\n   - Test performance impact on commit operations\n   - Ensure hooks work consistently across different developer environments\n\n5. **Biome Linting Rules Testing**:\n   - Run linter against codebase to verify rules are properly enabled\n   - Check that warnings are generated for rule violations\n   - Verify IDE integration shows warnings in real-time\n\n6. **Node.js Matrix Testing**:\n   - Verify CI runs tests against all specified Node.js versions\n   - Confirm all tests pass on each version\n   - Test with a feature that behaves differently across Node versions to ensure matrix testing catches compatibility issues\n\nDocument all testing procedures and results.
