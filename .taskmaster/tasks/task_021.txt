# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Robust Error Handling and Offline Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Add comprehensive error handling for network failures and API issues
# Details:
Implement graceful error handling for all Linear API calls. Ensure local operations always succeed regardless of network status. Add retry logic for transient failures and clear error messages for permanent failures. Implement offline operation support with sync queue.

# Test Strategy:
Test all operations with network disconnected. Verify appropriate error messages are shown without breaking local functionality. Test retry logic with simulated network failures and API rate limiting.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Wrap all API calls with try-catch [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling by wrapping all API calls throughout the application with try-catch blocks to gracefully handle network failures, server errors, and unexpected responses.
### Details:
Add try-catch blocks around all fetch calls, axios requests, and other API interactions. Include proper error logging and ensure errors are caught at the appropriate level for handling.

## 2. Implement offline detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to detect when the application goes offline or comes back online, providing real-time network status monitoring.
### Details:
Use navigator.onLine API and network event listeners to detect connectivity changes. Implement a service that broadcasts network status changes to relevant components.

## 3. Create sync queue for offline operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Design and implement a queue system that stores failed API operations when offline and automatically syncs them when connectivity is restored.
### Details:
Build a persistent queue using localStorage or IndexedDB to store pending operations. Include operation metadata, timestamps, and retry counts. Implement queue processing logic that triggers on network restoration.

## 4. Add retry logic with exponential backoff [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Implement intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed API calls to handle temporary network issues and server overload gracefully.
### Details:
Create a retry utility that implements exponential backoff algorithm with configurable max attempts, base delay, and jitter. Integrate with existing API error handling to automatically retry appropriate failures.

## 5. Design clear error messages [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Create user-friendly error messages and UI components that clearly communicate different types of errors and provide actionable guidance to users.
### Details:
Design error message templates for different scenarios (network errors, server errors, validation errors). Create error UI components with appropriate styling and user guidance. Implement error message localization support.

## 6. Ensure local operations never fail [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Implement robust local data operations with proper validation, fallbacks, and error recovery to ensure local functionality remains reliable even when network operations fail.
### Details:
Add comprehensive validation for local storage operations, implement data integrity checks, create fallback mechanisms for corrupted data, and ensure local state management is resilient to errors.
