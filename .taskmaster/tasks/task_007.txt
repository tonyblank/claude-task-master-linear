# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Linear ID Storage and File Update Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Add functionality to store Linear issue IDs back to Taskmaster task data
# Details:
Extend Taskmaster task schema to include linearIssueId, linearIssueNumber, and branchName fields. Implement safe file writing to update tasks.json with Linear metadata after successful issue creation. Handle file write failures gracefully and ensure data consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Test that Linear IDs are properly stored and persist across CLI sessions. Verify file integrity is maintained even if write operations are interrupted. Test with concurrent file access scenarios.
