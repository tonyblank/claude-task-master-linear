# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Complexity to Story Points Mapping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: low
# Description: Map Taskmaster complexity analysis to Linear story point estimates
# Details:
Implement mapping from Taskmaster's complexity ratings to Linear's estimate field using Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8). Allow configuration of complexity-to-points mapping and handle teams that don't use estimates. Integrate with Taskmaster's existing complexity analysis features.

# Test Strategy:
Test complexity mapping with various task complexity ratings. Verify story points are set correctly in Linear. Test with teams that have estimates disabled and ensure graceful fallback.
