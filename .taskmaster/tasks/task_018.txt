# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Task Dependency Sync to Linear Relations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Sync Taskmaster task dependencies as Linear issue relations
# Details:
Implement dependency sync using Linear's issue relation system. Create 'blocks' relationships where dependent tasks are blocked by their dependencies. Handle dependency creation after all related issues exist and manage dependency removal when tasks are updated.

# Test Strategy:
Test dependency creation with various dependency chains. Verify Linear shows proper blocking relationships. Test dependency removal and updates to ensure relations are maintained correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Map task dependencies to Linear IDs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a mapping system that translates internal task dependencies to corresponding Linear issue IDs, maintaining bidirectional lookup capabilities
### Details:
Implement a dependency mapping service that can convert between internal task identifiers and Linear issue IDs. This includes creating lookup tables, handling ID resolution, and maintaining consistency between systems.

## 2. Create relation mutations for blocking relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop GraphQL mutations to establish blocking relationships between Linear issues based on task dependencies
### Details:
Build mutation handlers that can create 'blocks' and 'blocked by' relationships in Linear using their relation API. Include proper error handling and validation for relationship creation.

## 3. Handle circular dependency detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Implement algorithms to detect and prevent circular dependencies before creating relationships in Linear
### Details:
Create a dependency graph analyzer that can traverse task relationships to identify circular references. Include validation logic that prevents creation of relationships that would create cycles.

## 4. Sync after all issues exist [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Implement a synchronization process that ensures all Linear issues are created before establishing dependency relationships
### Details:
Create a two-phase sync process where issues are created first, then relationships are established. Include proper sequencing, error recovery, and status tracking for the sync process.

## 5. Update relations on dependency changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.4
### Description: Build a system to detect dependency changes and update corresponding Linear relationships accordingly
### Details:
Implement change detection for task dependencies and create update handlers that can modify existing Linear relationships. Include diff calculation and incremental update capabilities.

## 6. Handle relation removal [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.5
### Description: Implement functionality to remove Linear relationships when task dependencies are deleted or modified
### Details:
Create deletion handlers that can safely remove Linear relationships when dependencies are removed. Include cleanup logic, orphan detection, and proper error handling for failed removals.
