# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Configuration Validation and Setup Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add validation for Linear configuration and connection testing
# Details:
Implement comprehensive validation for Linear configuration including API key validation, team access verification, and state mapping validation. Add connection testing during setup and provide clear feedback for configuration issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test setup with invalid API keys, inaccessible teams, and malformed configurations. Verify validation provides clear error messages and guidance for fixing issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create comprehensive config validation rules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a robust validation system for configuration files including schema validation, type checking, required field validation, and format verification for various config parameters
### Details:
Implement validation rules for all configuration parameters including data types, required fields, allowed values, format patterns (URLs, emails, etc.), and cross-field dependencies. Create validation schemas using JSON Schema or similar framework to ensure configs are properly structured and contain valid values before processing.

## 2. Implement API key verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Build secure API key validation system with proper authentication checks, key format validation, and expiration handling
### Details:
Create API key verification logic that validates key format, checks against authorized keys database/service, handles key expiration, implements rate limiting, and provides secure error handling without exposing sensitive information. Include support for different key types and scopes.

## 3. Add team/project access validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Implement authorization system to validate user permissions for specific teams and projects with role-based access control
### Details:
Develop access control validation that checks user permissions against team/project resources, implements role-based access (admin, member, viewer), validates resource ownership, handles team membership verification, and ensures users can only access authorized projects and perform permitted actions.

## 4. Create helpful error messages and fixes [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2, 24.3
### Description: Design user-friendly error messaging system with actionable suggestions and automated fix recommendations for common validation failures
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling that provides clear, actionable error messages for validation failures, suggests specific fixes for common issues, includes examples of correct formats, offers automated correction suggestions where possible, and creates a user-friendly error reporting system with proper error codes and documentation links.
