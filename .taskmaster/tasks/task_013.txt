# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Priority Mapping and Sync
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Map Taskmaster task priorities to Linear issue priorities
# Details:
Implement priority mapping from Taskmaster's low/medium/high priority system to Linear's priority field. Handle cases where Linear priority is disabled by using labels as fallback. Include priority in both issue creation and update operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test priority mapping with Linear teams that have priority enabled and disabled. Verify priorities are correctly set on issue creation and updated when task priorities change.
