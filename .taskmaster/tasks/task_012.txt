# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Task Deletion and Archival Sync
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Sync task removal operations to Linear by archiving corresponding issues
# Details:
Implement onTaskRemoved handler that archives Linear issues when Taskmaster tasks are deleted. Handle both regular task deletion and subtask removal. Ensure archived issues are properly hidden from active Linear views while preserving history.

# Test Strategy:
Test task deletion for both parent tasks and subtasks. Verify Linear issues are archived and no longer appear in active views. Test error handling when trying to archive non-existent issues.
