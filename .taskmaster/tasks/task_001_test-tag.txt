# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement TTS Flag for Taskmaster Commands
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add text-to-speech functionality to taskmaster commands with configurable voice options and audio output settings.
# Details:
Implement TTS functionality including:
- Add --tts flag to all relevant taskmaster commands (list, show, generate, etc.)
- Integrate with system TTS engines (Windows SAPI, macOS say command, Linux espeak/festival)
- Create TTS configuration options in the configuration management system
- Add voice selection options (male/female, different languages if available)
- Implement audio output settings (volume, speed, pitch)
- Add TTS-specific error handling for cases where TTS is unavailable
- Create fallback behavior when TTS fails (silent failure or text output)
- Support for reading task titles, descriptions, and status updates aloud
- Add option to read entire task lists or individual task details
- Implement TTS for command confirmations and error messages
- Create TTS output formatting to make spoken text more natural (removing markdown, formatting numbers/dates appropriately)
- Add configuration option to enable/disable TTS globally

# Test Strategy:
Test TTS functionality across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). Verify that the --tts flag works with all major commands. Test voice configuration options and ensure audio output settings are properly applied. Test error handling when TTS services are unavailable. Verify that text formatting for speech is natural and understandable. Test with various task content types including special characters, code snippets, and long descriptions. Ensure TTS can be disabled and enabled through configuration.
