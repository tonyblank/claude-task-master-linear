# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Basic Task Creation Sync to Linear
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core functionality to sync new Taskmaster tasks to Linear issues
# Details:
Implement the onTaskCreated handler that calls Linear's createIssue mutation. Map Taskmaster task fields (title, description, details, testStrategy) to Linear issue fields. Handle the API response to extract issue ID, identifier, and branch name. Implement error handling for API failures without breaking local task creation.

# Test Strategy:
Test task creation with various task configurations. Verify Linear issues are created with correct titles and descriptions. Test error scenarios like network failures and invalid team IDs.
