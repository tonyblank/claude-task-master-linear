# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Branch Name Capture and Storage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Capture Linear's suggested branch names and store them in Taskmaster tasks
# Details:
Modify issue creation to capture the branchName field from Linear's API response. Store branch names in Taskmaster task data for future use in git workflow automation. Ensure branch names are updated if Linear's branch naming scheme changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test that branch names are properly captured from Linear API responses. Verify branch names are stored in task data and persist across CLI sessions. Test with different Linear branch naming configurations.
