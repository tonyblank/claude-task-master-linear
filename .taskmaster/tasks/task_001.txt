# Title: Setup Project Dependencies and Linear SDK Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add Linear SDK to project dependencies and verify basic API connectivity
# Details:
Install @linear/sdk package via npm. Create a test script to verify Linear API connectivity using a development API key. Test basic GraphQL queries like fetching current user to ensure the SDK is properly configured and can communicate with Linear's API.

# Test Strategy:
Create a simple test that instantiates LinearClient with a test API key and makes a basic query. Verify the response is valid and no connection errors occur.
