# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Integration Manager and Event Hook System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the plugin architecture foundation for handling integration events
# Details:
Create an IntegrationManager class that can register integration plugins and emit events like 'taskCreated', 'taskUpdated', 'taskStatusChanged', 'taskRemoved'. Modify Taskmaster's core command handlers to emit these events after successful local operations. Design the system to be extensible for future integrations beyond Linear.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the IntegrationManager with mock integrations. Verify events are properly emitted and handled. Test that failed integration handlers don't break the main CLI flow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design the IntegrationManager class architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational architecture for the IntegrationManager class that will serve as the central hub for managing plugins and integrations. Define class structure, interfaces, and core methods.
### Details:
Design class hierarchy, define plugin interface contracts, establish initialization patterns, create plugin lifecycle management methods, and define configuration schema for plugin settings.

## 2. Implement event emitter system for task lifecycle events [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Build a robust event emitter system that can handle task lifecycle events throughout the application. This system will allow plugins to listen to and respond to various task states.
### Details:
Implement EventEmitter class with subscription/unsubscription methods, define standard task lifecycle events (created, started, completed, failed), add event filtering and priority handling, and ensure thread-safe event dispatching.

## 3. Create plugin registration mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Develop a secure and flexible plugin registration system that allows third-party plugins to register themselves with the IntegrationManager and declare their capabilities.
### Details:
Implement plugin discovery and loading mechanisms, create plugin validation and security checks, establish plugin metadata schema, add dynamic plugin loading/unloading capabilities, and create plugin dependency resolution system.

## 4. Modify core commands to emit events [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Update existing core command implementations to emit appropriate lifecycle events through the event system, enabling plugins to hook into command execution flows.
### Details:
Identify all core commands that need event emission, add event emission calls at key execution points, ensure consistent event data structures across commands, implement event emission for error conditions, and maintain backward compatibility.

## 5. Add error isolation for plugin failures [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive error isolation mechanisms to prevent plugin failures from affecting core system functionality or other plugins, ensuring system stability.
### Details:
Create plugin sandboxing mechanisms, implement try-catch wrappers for plugin execution, add plugin health monitoring and automatic recovery, create error reporting and logging for plugin failures, and establish plugin quarantine procedures for repeated failures.
