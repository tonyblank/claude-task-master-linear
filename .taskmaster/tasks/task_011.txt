# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Subtask Creation and Hierarchy Sync
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for syncing Taskmaster subtasks as Linear sub-issues
# Details:
Implement subtask creation sync using Linear's parentId field to create hierarchical issue relationships. Handle both new subtask creation and conversion of existing tasks to subtasks. Ensure parent-child relationships are properly maintained in Linear when tasks are restructured.

# Test Strategy:
Test creating subtasks under existing tasks. Verify Linear displays proper parent-child relationships. Test converting existing tasks to subtasks and ensure Linear relationships are updated correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Detect parent-child relationships in tasks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement logic to identify and track hierarchical relationships between tasks, including detection of existing parent-child structures and validation of relationship integrity
### Details:
Create algorithms to traverse task structures, identify parent-child links, detect orphaned tasks, and validate relationship consistency. Include methods to query task hierarchy depth and sibling relationships.

## 2. Implement subtask creation with parentId [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop functionality to create new subtasks with proper parent task references, including validation and automatic hierarchy establishment
### Details:
Build subtask creation API that accepts parentId parameter, validates parent task existence, establishes bidirectional relationships, and updates parent task metadata to reflect new child tasks.

## 3. Handle task-to-subtask conversions [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Create mechanisms to convert existing standalone tasks into subtasks of other tasks, managing the restructuring of task hierarchies
### Details:
Implement conversion logic that reassigns task parentage, updates all affected relationships, preserves task data integrity, and handles cascading updates to dependent tasks and references.

## 4. Maintain hierarchy consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Establish validation rules and automated checks to ensure task hierarchy remains consistent during all operations, preventing circular dependencies and orphaned tasks
### Details:
Create validation functions for circular dependency detection, orphan task prevention, hierarchy depth limits, and automated consistency repair mechanisms. Include transaction rollback capabilities for failed operations.

## 5. Test complex nesting scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive test suite covering deep nesting, bulk operations, edge cases, and performance testing for hierarchical task management
### Details:
Create test cases for multi-level nesting (5+ levels deep), bulk task conversions, concurrent hierarchy modifications, error recovery scenarios, and performance benchmarks for large task hierarchies (1000+ tasks).
