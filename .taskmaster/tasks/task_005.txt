# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main LinearIntegration class with basic Linear API client initialization
# Details:
Create LinearIntegration class that implements event handlers for task operations. Initialize Linear client with API key from environment. Implement basic error handling and logging for Linear API calls. Structure the module to be self-contained and pluggable into the Integration Manager.
