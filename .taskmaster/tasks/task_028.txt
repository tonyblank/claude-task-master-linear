# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Create unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing for the Linear sync feature
# Details:
Implement unit tests for all integration components including LinearIntegration class, state mapping, and error handling. Create integration tests using Linear API sandbox or mocks. Develop end-to-end tests covering complete user workflows from setup to task management.

# Test Strategy:
Achieve high test coverage for all integration code. Test with real Linear API in sandbox environment. Verify all user workflows work correctly from initial setup through daily task management.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up test fixtures and utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create reusable test fixtures, mock data generators, and utility functions to support comprehensive testing across all levels
### Details:
Establish foundational test infrastructure including mock Linear API responses, sample project data, user fixtures, and common test utilities for database seeding, authentication mocking, and assertion helpers

## 2. Create unit tests for core modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit tests for individual components, services, and utility functions with high code coverage
### Details:
Write isolated unit tests for authentication, data processing, API client modules, validation logic, and business rule implementations using Jest/Vitest with proper mocking of external dependencies

## 3. Implement integration tests with mocked Linear API [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1, 28.2
### Description: Build integration tests that verify component interactions while using mocked Linear API responses
### Details:
Create tests that validate end-to-end data flow between frontend and backend components using realistic Linear API mocks, testing error handling, data transformation, and state management

## 4. Add end-to-end tests for user workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive E2E tests covering critical user journeys and workflows using browser automation
### Details:
Use Playwright or Cypress to test complete user scenarios including login, project creation, issue management, team collaboration, and Linear synchronization workflows in a real browser environment

## 5. Configure CI/CD test running [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.2, 28.3, 28.4
### Description: Set up automated test execution in continuous integration pipeline with proper reporting and failure handling
### Details:
Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD platform to run all test suites on pull requests and merges, including parallel test execution, test result reporting, and integration with code coverage tools

## 6. Achieve coverage targets [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.2, 28.3, 28.4, 28.5
### Description: Optimize test coverage to meet project standards and identify gaps in test coverage across all modules
### Details:
Use coverage tools like Istanbul/NYC to measure and improve code coverage, aiming for 80%+ coverage on critical paths, generate coverage reports, and implement coverage gates in CI/CD pipeline
