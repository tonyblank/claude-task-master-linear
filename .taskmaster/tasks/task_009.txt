# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Linear Workflow State Mapping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create system to map Taskmaster statuses to Linear workflow states
# Details:
Query Linear team's workflow states during setup and create mapping between Taskmaster statuses (pending, in-progress, review, done, cancelled) and Linear state IDs. Store mappings in config and provide fallback handling for missing states. Implement helper functions to retrieve state IDs for status updates.

# Test Strategy:
Test state mapping with teams that have standard and custom workflow states. Verify that missing states are handled gracefully with appropriate fallbacks or user warnings.
