# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Rate Limiting and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add rate limiting protection and optimize API call performance
# Details:
Implement rate limiting detection and backoff strategies for Linear API calls. Optimize bulk operations to avoid hitting rate limits. Add progress indicators for long-running sync operations and implement efficient batching where possible.

# Test Strategy:
Test with rapid task creation to trigger rate limiting. Verify backoff strategies work correctly. Test performance with large numbers of tasks and ensure reasonable response times.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Detect rate limit responses [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement detection mechanisms for rate limit responses from APIs including HTTP status codes (429, 503), response headers (X-RateLimit-*, Retry-After), and response body patterns to identify when rate limits are hit
### Details:
Create a rate limit detector that monitors HTTP responses for common rate limiting indicators such as 429 Too Many Requests status codes, rate limit headers like X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, and Retry-After headers. Include parsing of response bodies for rate limit messages and implement logging for rate limit events.

## 2. Implement backoff strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Develop exponential backoff, linear backoff, and jittered backoff algorithms to handle rate limit scenarios gracefully with configurable parameters for retry attempts, base delay, and maximum wait times
### Details:
Create multiple backoff strategy implementations including exponential backoff with configurable base delay and multiplier, linear backoff with fixed increments, and jittered backoff to prevent thundering herd problems. Include retry logic with maximum attempt limits and respect for Retry-After headers when provided by the API.

## 3. Add request batching where possible [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Implement request batching mechanisms to group multiple API calls into single requests where supported by the API, including batch size optimization and error handling for partial batch failures
### Details:
Design a batching system that can group similar API requests into batches based on API capabilities. Include configurable batch sizes, timeout handling for batch requests, and logic to handle partial failures within batches. Implement fallback to individual requests when batching fails.

## 4. Create progress indicators for long operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.3
### Description: Develop progress tracking and user feedback mechanisms for long-running operations including progress bars, estimated time remaining, and status updates for batch processing and rate-limited operations
### Details:
Build a progress indication system that tracks completion percentage, estimated time remaining, and current operation status. Include visual progress bars for UI applications, console progress indicators for CLI tools, and callback mechanisms for custom progress handling. Integrate with batching and backoff systems to provide accurate progress updates.
