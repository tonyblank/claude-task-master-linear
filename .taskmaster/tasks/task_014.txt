# Description: Create and manage the 'Taskmaster' label for identifying synced issues
# Details:
Implement label creation functionality to automatically create a 'Taskmaster' label in Linear if it doesn't exist. Apply this label to all synced issues for easy identification. Include configuration option to disable label application if users prefer unlabeled issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test label creation on first sync operation. Verify label is applied to all created issues. Test with teams where label already exists and ensure no duplicates are created.
