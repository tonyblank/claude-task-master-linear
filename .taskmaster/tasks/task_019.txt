# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Bulk Task Sync for Parse-PRD Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Handle syncing of multiple tasks created simultaneously from PRD parsing
# Details:
Implement efficient bulk sync handling for parse-prd command that creates many tasks at once. Create issues sequentially to avoid rate limiting, then handle dependency relations after all issues exist. Provide progress feedback and error summary for bulk operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test bulk sync with PRDs that generate 20+ tasks. Verify all issues are created correctly and dependencies are properly linked. Test error handling when some issues fail to create in bulk operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Detect bulk operation mode [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement detection logic to identify when multiple issues need to be created simultaneously and determine the appropriate bulk processing strategy
### Details:
Create detection mechanisms to identify bulk operations based on input size, user intent, or configuration flags. Implement threshold-based detection and mode switching logic.

## 2. Implement sequential issue creation with progress [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Build sequential processing system that creates issues one by one while providing real-time progress feedback to users
### Details:
Develop sequential creation workflow with progress tracking, rate limiting compliance, and user feedback mechanisms. Include progress bars, status updates, and estimated completion times.

## 3. Collect all Linear IDs for dependency linking [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Implement system to capture and store all created Linear issue IDs during bulk operations for subsequent dependency relationship establishment
### Details:
Create ID collection mechanism that tracks all successfully created issues, maintains mapping between original requests and Linear IDs, and prepares data structure for dependency linking.

## 4. Handle partial failures gracefully [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Develop robust error handling system that manages partial failures during bulk operations without compromising successful creations
### Details:
Implement failure recovery mechanisms, retry logic for failed operations, rollback strategies where appropriate, and comprehensive error reporting that distinguishes between recoverable and permanent failures.

## 5. Provide bulk operation summary [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Create comprehensive reporting system that provides detailed summary of bulk operation results including successes, failures, and created dependencies
### Details:
Build summary generation that includes success/failure counts, created issue IDs, established dependencies, error details, and actionable next steps for any failed operations.
