# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** test the fix for duplicate saves - final test

**Response:**

## Steps to Test the Fix for Duplicate Saves

**1. Prepare a Clean Test Environment**
- Ensure the tasks.json file and any related data stores are in a known, clean state with no pre-existing duplicate entries.
- Back up the current tasks.json in case rollback is needed.

**2. Define Test Scenarios**
- Attempt to save a new task with unique data.
- Attempt to save a task with the same ID or unique identifier as an existing task (simulate a duplicate).
- Attempt to save a task with the same title or content but a different ID (to test if the fix is based on ID or content).
- Simultaneously trigger multiple save operations (if the system supports concurrency) to test race conditions.

**3. Execute Manual and Automated Tests**
- Use the application's UI or API to create and save tasks as per the scenarios above.
- For each save operation, check the tasks.json file or the data store to verify:
  - No duplicate entries are created.
  - Existing tasks are not overwritten unless intended (e.g., for updates).
  - The system returns appropriate error messages or warnings when a duplicate save is attempted.

**4. Validate System Behavior**
- Confirm that after all test operations, each task in tasks.json is unique according to the defined criteria (ID, title, or other unique fields).
- If the system is designed to merge duplicates, verify that merging occurs as expected.
- If the system is designed to reject duplicates, ensure that the rejection is clear and no duplicate is present.

**5. Test Edge Cases**
- Attempt to save tasks with minor variations (e.g., whitespace differences, case sensitivity) to ensure the duplicate detection logic is robust.
- Test with large numbers of tasks to ensure performance and correctness at scale.

**6. Review Logs and Error Handling**
- Check application logs for any errors or warnings related to duplicate saves.
- Ensure that error handling is user-friendly and provides actionable feedback.

**7. Regression Testing**
- Run the full suite of task operations (create, update, delete) to ensure the fix for duplicate saves does not introduce new issues elsewhere in the system.

## Additional Best Practices

- Communicate test results with the team to confirm the fix is effective and to prevent future regressions[1][2][5].
- Consider implementing automated duplicate detection as part of the save operation to prevent future issues[2][3].
- Document the test cases and results for future reference and audits.

## Example Test Case Table

| Test Scenario                        | Expected Result                | Actual Result | Pass/Fail |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Save unique task                     | Task saved                    |               |           |
| Save duplicate task (same ID)        | Duplicate rejected/merged     |               |           |
| Save duplicate task (same title)     | Duplicate rejected/merged     |               |           |
| Simultaneous saves (race condition)  | Only one unique task present  |               |           |
| Save with minor variations           | No false positives/negatives  |               |           |

Fill in the "Actual Result" and "Pass/Fail" columns during testing.

## Action Items

- Complete all test scenarios above.
- Document any issues found and retest after fixes.
- Confirm with stakeholders before closing the issue.
