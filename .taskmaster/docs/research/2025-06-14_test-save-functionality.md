# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** test save functionality

**Response:**

## Testing Save Functionality in a Task Management System

**Core Steps for Testing Save Functionality**

- Create or update a task in the system using the CLI or UI.
- Trigger the save operation (e.g., by issuing a command or clicking a save button).
- Verify that the data is correctly written to the persistent storage (e.g., `tasks.json`).
- Reload or re-query the data to ensure the saved changes persist and are accurately reflected.
- Validate that all required fields and relationships (such as dependencies and subtasks) are preserved and correctly structured.

**Key Test Scenarios**

- **Basic Save:** Add a new task and confirm it appears in `tasks.json` with all fields populated.
- **Update Save:** Modify an existing task (e.g., change status, description, or priority) and verify the changes are saved.
- **Subtask and Dependency Preservation:** Update a parent task and ensure that completed subtasks and dependency links remain intact, especially after using commands like `updateTask`.
- **Batch Operations:** Perform bulk updates or additions and confirm all affected tasks are saved correctly, with no data loss or corruption.
- **Validation:** Attempt to save invalid data and ensure the system rejects it or provides meaningful error messages, confirming validation logic is enforced.

**Recommended Practices**

- Use automated tests to simulate save operations for various scenarios, including edge cases (e.g., circular dependencies, missing required fields).
- After each save, reload the data and compare it to the expected state to ensure integrity.
- Log all save operations and errors for traceability and debugging.
- Regularly back up the `tasks.json` file to prevent data loss during testing and development.

**Relevant Features from Industry Standards**

- Task management systems typically provide robust save and update mechanisms, ensuring that all task attributes (including dependencies, subtasks, and comments) are consistently maintained[1][2][5].
- Validation and error handling are critical to prevent corrupt or incomplete saves, especially when handling complex relationships or batch operations[1][5].
- User feedback (such as success messages or error alerts) is important for confirming save actions and guiding users in case of issues[1][2].

**Example Test Case**

1. Create a task with subtasks and dependencies.
2. Mark some subtasks as complete.
3. Use the `updateTask` command to modify the parent task.
4. Save and reload the data.
5. Assert that:
   - The parent task reflects the updates.
   - Completed subtasks remain marked as complete.
   - Dependencies are unchanged and valid.

**Summary Table: Save Functionality Test Aspects**

| Aspect                | What to Test                                      | Expected Outcome                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Basic Save            | Add/update task, save, reload                     | Data persists and matches expectations  |
| Subtask Preservation  | Update parent, check subtask status               | Completed subtasks remain complete      |
| Dependency Handling   | Save with dependencies, reload                    | Dependencies are intact and valid       |
| Batch Operations      | Bulk save/update, reload                          | All changes persist, no data loss       |
| Validation            | Save invalid data                                 | Error is raised, data not corrupted     |

These steps and scenarios ensure that the save functionality is robust, reliable, and meets the requirements of a modern task management system[1][2][5].
